# HEIC-to-JPG

I have developed a Python code that converts HEIC images to JPG images. The code is efficient and reliable, and it produces high-quality JPG images from HEIC images.

The code works by first scanning the specified folder for HEIC images. Once it has found all of the HEIC images, it first gives a count of the number of files present with the given extension, then it converts each image to a JPG and saves it in the same folder. The code also preserves the original filename of each HEIC image, so that the converted JPG images can be easily identified.

To use the code, simply specify the folder path where your HEIC images are stored. The code will then automatically convert all of the HEIC images in the folder to JPG images.
