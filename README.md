# HEIC to JPG Converter: For All Your Bulk Image Conversion Needs

Python code for converting HEIC images to JPG images in bulk

This Python code converts HEIC images to JPG images in bulk, using the Pillow library. The code is efficient and reliable, and it produces high-quality JPG images from HEIC images.

The code works by first scanning the specified folder for HEIC images. Once it has found all of the HEIC images, it converts each image to JPG and saves it in the same folder. The code also preserves the original filename of each HEIC image, so that the converted JPG images can be easily identified.

The code can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

1. Converting HEIC images from a smartphone to JPG images for use on a website or social media platform.
2. Converting HEIC images from a digital camera to JPG images for storage or editing.
3. Converting HEIC images from a legacy operating system to JPG images for use on a newer operating system.

To use the code, simply specify the folder path where your HEIC images are stored. The code will then automatically convert all of the HEIC images in the folder to JPG images.

Features:

1. Efficient and reliable conversion of HEIC images to JPG images in bulk.
2. Production of high-quality JPG images from HEIC images.
3. Preservation of the original filename of each HEIC image when saving the converted JPG image.

Benefits

1. Reduces the file size of HEIC images, which can improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage
2. Makes HEIC images compatible with older devices and software that do not support HEIC images
3. Makes it easier to share HEIC images on social media and other platforms
